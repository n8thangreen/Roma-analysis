The objective of this work is to assess the role that community influence has in creating
barriers to access healthcare services for Roma in the Western Balkans. The analysis relies on
the use of 2017 UNDP Roma Regional Survey, which represents the most updated source on
Roma communities in the Western Balkans. The empirical results show a negative effect of
Roma community support systems on accessing preventive medical screenings and a positive effect
of perceived ethnic discrimination on healthcare avoidance. These correlations are
sufficiently robust to omitted variable bias, once controlling for the remoteness and cohesion
of the community and after performing Oster (2019) strategy for selection on unobservables.
The results suggest an additional focus for policy makers, aiming in reducing health gaps of
Roma, on the role that the community has in influencing the individual’s healthcare seeking
behaviors.
